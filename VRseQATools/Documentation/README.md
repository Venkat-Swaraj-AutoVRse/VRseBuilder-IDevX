#  QAVOCheatCode

> ‚ú® A Unity tool for dynamically changing VO pitch during VR QA using Oculus controller combos.

---

##  Features

- Adjust VO playback speed **on-the-fly** in VR.
- Simple Oculus Touch **combo inputs**:
  - `X + A` = Decrease pitch
  - `Y + B` = Increase pitch
- Combo **cooldown system** to prevent spam.
- Includes **haptic feedback** for tactile confirmation.
- Pitch is clamped between min and max to maintain audio quality.

## Controller Combos

| Combo        | Action         | Result              |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| `X` + `A`     | Decrease Pitch | Slows VO playback   |
| `Y` + `B`     | Increase Pitch | Speeds up VO        |

‚ö†Ô∏è Cooldown between activations is controlled by `_comboCooldownDuration`.

## Future Plans
- To add more utility scripts to help speed up testing for QA Team and as well as developers
